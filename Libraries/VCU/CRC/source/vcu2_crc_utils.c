// \brief Workaround to the silicon issue of first VCU calculation on power up being
// erroneous
//
// Details Due to the internal power-up state of the VCU module, it is possible
// that the first CRC result will be incorrect. This condition applies to the
// first result from each of the eight CRC instructions.
// This rare condition can only occur after a power-on reset, but will not
// necessarily occur on every power on. A warm reset will not cause this condition
// to reappear.
// Workaround(s) The application can reset the internal VCU CRC logic by
// performing a CRC calculation of a single byte in the initialization routine.
// This routine only needs to perform one CRC calculation and can use any of the
// CRC instructions
